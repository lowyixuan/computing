**A Short Story on Mdm Sim, our Higher Chinese Language teacher**

**Section 1: _First impression of teacher_**

(about how fierce she looked and everyone thought she was an intimidating teacher)

**Section 2: _First lesson with teacher_**

(how we did the 自我介绍 and how she laughed along. She was interested in what we were saying and seems friendly and nice? You can also add how she was "horrified" by the pets some 
of us used to have)

**Section 3: _Subsequent lessons with teacher_**

can say smthg like 先抑后扬 you know? like how you intially found her scary then your impression changes?  She also calls some ppl by their English name and some by their Chinese name. (hAi also like maybe how she would chase after us for homework and expectations for exams etc iDK sorry if this is crappy :p)

**Section 4: _Conversations with teacher_**

(how she has great confidence in us that we would do well, and how she engaged the class a lot and told stories and opinions which are interesting)
(talking to her was like talking to a friend)

**Section 5: _Appreciation of teacher_**

(how she would help with anything you ask, and also care for us and stuff?)

**Section 6: _Summary and well wishes_**

_(idea used by Regina and Jody)_

Thank you Mdm Sim!
